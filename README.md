## Problem Statement
AtliQo, a leading telecom provider in India, experienced a noticeable decline in active users and revenue growth following the launch of its 5G plans in May 2022. The management is concerned about the impact of the 5G rollout and has tasked the analytics team with conducting a comprehensive analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs) before and after the 5G launch. The objective is to identify patterns, trends, and potential areas of improvement that could help recover user engagement and revenue. Additionally, the company is exploring opportunities to optimize its internet plans to attract and retain more active users. Peter Pandey, a junior data analyst, is responsible for delivering actionable insights through this comparative analysis.

## Objectives:
 - Compare KPIs before and after the 5G launch (May 2022)
   - Analyze trends in active users, revenue, churn rate, average data consumption, and customer satisfaction scores.
- Identify key factors contributing to the decline in active users and revenue
   - Correlate customer behavior and usage patterns with changes in pricing, network performance, and plan features.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the 5G plans
   - Determine if the 5G plans have met customer expectations and assess their adoption rate.
- Recommend data-driven strategies to recover user engagement and optimize performance
   - Suggest improvements in plan pricing, customer segmentation, and marketing efforts based on insights.
 
### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is excel file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset" to check the empty and error percentage.
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present
- Step 5 :the data contains various KPI metrics, thus in order to represent revenue,active users, unsubscribes users and market share, a new visual was added using the line graph and to show the performance before and after the launch of 5G bar graph was used in the visualizations pane in report view. 
- Step 6 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for the month and City field.
- Step 7 : Line graph is used to revenue generated by each plan 
- Step 8 : Bar chart were used to show revenue by city showing revenue before and after the launcg of 5G
- Step 9 : Table chart used to represent the plan name, plan description, revenue generated though each plan
- Step 10 : Donut chart used to show the Top 5 and Bottom 5 revenue generating plans before and after 5G launch
- Step 10 : Bar graph used to show the active users, unsubscribed users and average market valuation before and after 5G and line chart is used to show their trend
- Step 11 : Funnel chart used to represent the market share position
        
- Step 12 : New measure was created to find total the `

# Insights

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;


## Revenue
Slight revenue decline of ₹8 Cr (~0.5%) observed post 5G launch.
ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) increased from ₹190 to ₹200.
No major revenue variation across cities pre and post-5G.
Notable dip in June revenue, recovery in July, and a slight decline in September.

### Possible Causes:
Revenue drop attributed to rise in user churn.
ARPU increase driven by plan revisions.


## Plan Performance

Significant growth in revenue from Plan P1 (likely due to combo offering).
Plans P8, P9, P10 discontinued after 5G launch.
New Plans P11 and P12 show strong performance post-launch.
Revenue declined from Plans P4 to P7, which existed both pre- and post-5G.

### Possible Causes:

P1's success linked to attractive bundled features.
Low-performing plans replaced with new offerings (P11–P13).
P11 and P12 gained rapid user adoption.
City-wise revenue remains stable, as higher ARPU offsets subscriber loss.


## Active Users

Active users dropped by ~70 Lakh (8.28%) post-5G.
User count declined in all cities except Pune (slight increase) and Chennai (stable).
Steady decline in active users from July onwards.

### Suggestions:

Deploy field teams to conduct surveys on user attrition.
Analyze Pune’s growth strategy for broader application.


## Unsubscribed Users

13.24 Lakh users unsubscribed post-5G (~8.25% decline).
Churn increased across most cities, except Mumbai.

### Suggestions:
Conduct targeted surveys to understand churn drivers.


## Market Valuation

Market valuation rose by over ₹670 Cr after 5G launch.
Atliq now commands 20% market share.

### Possible Causes:

New tech introduction typically boosts valuation.
Sustained market share growth hinges on pricing, customer acquisition, and service quality.


 ## Analysis

1. With the above dashboard we can determine the best and worst plans generating revenue and revenue contribution from each city. Atliqo can increase their revenue by focusing more on combo offers than indiviual pack and offer additional benifits such as free OTT subscription.
 
2. High churn rate in nearly all cities can be observered, field team to run surveys to understand the reason behind it.

3. From the report it is clear that there has been a downfall in revenue, active users and increase in unsubscribed users
